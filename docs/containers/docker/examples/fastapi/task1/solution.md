If you've explored the docs and tried things out â€” great!

Here's a simple example of how to run a FastAPI app using the `uv` package manager inside a Docker container.

This is based on:

- [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [uv Docker guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/docker/)

Feel free to adapt this example to your own needs.
