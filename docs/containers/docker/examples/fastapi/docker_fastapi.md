# Create an hello word FastAPI app without Docker

- Understand the steps to create a FastAPI app:
- Go to the [FastAPI documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- Use good practices like use a virtual environment and a requirements.txt file
- Create a simple FastAPI app in a file called `main.py` and run it.

# Create a FastAPI app with Docker

- Replicate the steps from the previous section but this time use Docker so you can run the app in a container.
