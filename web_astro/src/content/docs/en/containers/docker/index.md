## Challenges / Ready to use templates

If you‚Äôre new to Docker, keep these principles in mind before tackling the challenges:

- Make sure you understand every tool involved‚Äîespecially the programming language, framework and how to install its dependencies.

- Verify that you can run the application in a local environment and you understand how to do it.

- Rely on the official documentation and reputable community resources.

- Attempt each challenge on your own first; working through it yourself will deepen your understanding.

If you‚Äôd rather jump straight to a ready‚Äëto‚Äëuse template, head to the Solution section and clone the repository there, or visit the project directly on GitHub.
